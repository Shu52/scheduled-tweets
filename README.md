This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* If you are using WSL2 to run Ruby on Windows, then make sure your Hyper-V is on

* Frustrating! On WSL2, I had to convert files for bin/webpack-dev-server to work
'git config --global core.autocrlf input'
'find ./ -type f -exec dos2unix {} \;'
